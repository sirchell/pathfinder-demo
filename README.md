#  ChellPathFinder — Demo

**Tiny, handcrafted wordlist & static demo** showcasing directory discovery concepts — by **Chell**.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This repository is a **demonstration only**. It contains a curated wordlist and a static demo that visualizes sample scan outputs. It does **not** include an active scanner. Do **not** use any scanning tools against systems you do not own or have explicit written permission to test.

---

## What this repo contains

- `wordlist.txt` — Curated list of common admin, config, backup and public paths (handcrafted).
- `demo/index.html` — Static demo page that visualizes example scan results (no network requests).
- `README.md` — This file.
- `LICENSE` — Recommended: MIT or choose what you prefer.

## Why this repo

Designed to present my real-world focus as a bug hunter while staying ethical. Use this as a portfolio piece — put it on your profile, pin it, and enable GitHub Pages on the `demo/` folder to show the static demo on your profile.

## Responsible use & ethics

Only perform active scanning or probing when you have explicit written permission from the asset owner. This demo is intentionally static to show methodology without providing runnable scanning tools.

## Contributing / Notes

If you want this turned into a richer portfolio page (timeline of hunts, anonymized case studies, stylized CV), open an issue or PR — I’ll maintain the demo look and human-first wording to keep it authentic.
